        "**1.** In this project, we began by exploring a dataset that contains information about hotel bookings. The dataset includes two types of hotels: City Hotel and Resort Hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.** The dataset consists of 119,390 rows and 32 columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.** All the columns in the dataset are divided into three data types: Object, Float, and Int.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.** The dataset contains duplicate values as well as null values. There are a total of 31,994 duplicate values, and four columns have missing values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.** The column with the maximum number of missing values is \"Company,\" followed by \"Agent,\" \"Country,\" and \"Children.\" The \"Children\" column has only four null values, while the \"Company\" column has 112,593 null values. The dataset has 119,390 rows and 32 columns in total.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.** For the data manipulation workflow in this project, we divided it into three categories: Data collection, Data cleaning and manipulation, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.** To collect the data, we used various basic functions and attributes such as Head(), Tail(), Info(), Describe(), and Columns() to understand the dataset better.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8.** Since the dataset contains both duplicate and missing values, we had to handle them accordingly. We replaced the null and missing values and dropped the duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9.** We also converted the data types of columns to their appropriate types and added some new columns. Additionally, we dropped rows where the combined values of adults, babies, and children were 0, indicating no guests and no bookings made.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10.** We have found that there were some rows in which the combining values of adults,babies and childrens was 0 so this simply means there were no guests as 0 indicates presence of none.So there were no bookings made.So as as result ,We simply dropped in the rows where combining values of adults,babies and children columns was 0\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**11.** The data type of the \"reservation_status_date\" column was initially object type, so we converted it to date type for better utilization. We also added two new columns: \"total_people\" and \"total_stay.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**12.** Before proceeding with data visualization, we conducted data wrangling, which involved checking for null values in all the columns. Once the data wrangling process was completed, we moved on to the data visualization part.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.** In the data visualization phase, we followed a structured approach, adhering to the \"UBM\" rule:\n",
        "\n",
        "U - Univariate Analysis: We performed visualizations to analyze individual variables and understand their distributions, such as histograms, bar charts, or count plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "B - Bivariate Analysis (Numerical-Categorical): We explored the relationship between numerical and categorical variables using appropriate visualizations like box plots, violin plots, or grouped bar charts. This allowed us to identify any patterns or dependencies between different variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "M - Multivariate Analysis: We delved into visualizations involving multiple variables to uncover complex relationships and dependencies. Heatmaps, scatter plots, or parallel coordinate plots were used to gain insights from multiple dimensions simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "**.** Throughout the data visualization process, we utilized various charts and graphs, carefully examining them to extract meaningful insights that would contribute to business outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**.** Additionally, we employed correlation matrices to understand the relationships between different columns. This played a crucial role in comprehending the overall interplay within the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "**.** By conducting exploratory data analysis and data visualization, we were able to discover and highlight important factors that govern hotel bookings, leading to a deeper understanding of the dataset."
